    <section><h2>Why do you care so much and why should I?</h2>
	  <p>
	    This question has haunted me since adopting her in the summer of 2020. This is Ophelia, my very 
	    friendly and gorgeous dog. I remember seeing her picture on <a href="https://adoptapet.com/">AdoptAPet.com</a> 
	    and thinking, "I wonder what breed she is. Better remember to ask when I visit her."
	  </p> 
	  <p><strong>Spoiler Alert:</strong> I forgot to ask.</p>
	  <p>
	    This may not be widely known but this causes identity issues within Ophie. She doesn't truly know
	    who she is or where she caem from. Everyone deserves to know where they come from. So, I ask this 
	    question not for myself but for her.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Okay, also so I don't seem like a bad owner whenever a fellow dog owner asks me what breed she is.
	    It's embarassing and I feel like Dog Protection Services will take her from me.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Anyway, you may already have an answer but that's not the point. This is obviously an excuse for me to 
	    show pictures of my dog and other dogs that are not as cute as her but look like her. So the following 
	    are potentially what breed my dog is. I will also rate the dog used in the sample photo by how cute they 
	    are compared to Ophelia.
	  </p>

	<section><h2>Norwegian Elkhound?</h2>
	  <img src="images/norwegian-elkhound-dog-breed.jpeg" alt="Elkhound" height="450" width="650" >
	  <p>
	    Off to a pretty weak start. I tried this app that guesses your dog's breed and it gave a 20% chance 
	    that she was part Norwegian Elkhound. Makes kinda sense. The body shape is about the same, including 
	    the tail. I only express doubt in its fur. Compare it to Ophelia. 
	  </p>
	  <img src="images/sleepingophie.jpg" alt="Sleeping Ophie" height="550" width="800" >
	  <p>
	    Like I said, similar body shape, but obviously different type of fur. Overall, a fair chance of 
	    having these 'hound' genes. Would not mind having this dog either.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <strong>Rating: 11/10</strong> - Would enjoy an elkhound to bring me elk and still looks like it has 
	    nice fur coat.
	  </p>

	<section><h2>Belgian Tervurian?</h2>
	  <img src="images/tervurian.jpg" alt="Tervurian" height="450" width="650" >
	  <p>
	    So this was the other part that the app thought was in my dog's genes. The fur from this one on 
	    the elkhound's body? Definitely possible. As cute as my Ophelia? Absolutely not. But respect for 
        maintaining an elegant coat. Now lets compare to Ophelia in a similar stance and environment.	  
      </p>
	  <img src="images/outsideophie.jpg" alt="Ophie but Outside" height="600" width="800" >
	  <p>
	    <strong>Rating: 10/10</strong> - All it has is the fur and color but way to big. Still gets at 
	    least a 10 just for being a dog.
	  </p>

    <section><h2>Pomeranian?</h2>
	  <img src="images/pomeranian.jpg" alt="Pomeranian" height="450" width="650" >
	  <p> 
	    I know this seems absurd, but hear me out. This theory comes from the fact that I had this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isthatcake/video/7030242625798081797?_t=8PWYsExUefW&_r=1">video</a>
	    sent to me by a relative. If you follow the link to the video, this person's video is tagged #pomeranion 
	    like probably 5 times. I actually spoke to the person by commenting on their video because you cannot 
	    deny the resemblance. They confirmed that their dog is a pomeranion mix and they saw some videos of mine
	    and theorize that my Ophelia must also be. That is about as much information as I needed to believe it at 
	    least a little. Also, this photo of Ophie running kind of gives a Pomeranian shape. 
	  </p>
	  <img src="images/zoomingophie.png" alt="Ophie Running" height="550" width="800" >
	  <p>Almost uncanny.</p>
	  <p>
	    <strong>Rating: 13/10</strong> - Too small for me but undoubtedly adorable. Would stuff one in my coat for
	    extra warmth. Also, increases value of my dog I think. Not that I would sell her or anything...

	<section><h2>GNOME?</h2>
	  <img src="images/gnome.jpg" alt="A Gnome" >
	  <p>
	    I can already hear you: "But these went extinct hundreds of years ago!" That's what I thought too!
	    However, an absolute crazy thing happened one day near the end of October on Halloween 2020.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    There I was waking up on an extra spooky day ready to greet my dog like every other morning. She 
	    usually lays near my feet but when I look at my feet all I see is this:
	  </p>
	  <img src="images/gnomeophie.jpg" alt="Also a Gnome?" height="650" width="550" >
	  <p>Absolutely uncanny.</p>
	  <p>
	    <strong>Rating:-100/10</strong> - Gave me trust issues and worsened my ever increasing fear of gnomes.
	  </p>
	</section>
	
	<section><h2>Sheltie?</h2>
	  <img src="images/sheltie.jpg" alt="Sheltie" height="450" width="650" >
	  <p>
	    Hopefully I'm wrong about the horrifying possibility of gnomes being back and perhaps this is the 
	    true answer. Now,I know after all these other theories that this seems even less likely than gnomes 
	    returning from extinction, but I do not mean pure sheltie like the one above. I mean what results 
	    from searching 'Sheltie Mix" in Google:
	  </p>
	  <img src="images/sheltiemix1.jpg" alt="Sheltie Mix 1" height="550" width="450" >
	  <img src="images/sheltiemix2.jpg" alt="Sheltie Mix 2" height="450" width="650" >
	  <img src="images/ophieshake.jpg" alt="Ophie putting up her paw" height="800" width="550" >
      <p>Yeah, you're probably right. I'm leaning more towards her being a gnome in disguise.</p>
