    <section><h2>What the heck is that armored shrew thing?</h2>
	  <p>
	    That "armored shrew thing" is an armadillo. Duh. Figured that would be obvious. Anyway, you should 
	    know what its called but there are certain facts about it you may not know. That's what this page
	    is all about! Here are a few fun facts about armadillos.
	  </p> 
    </section>
  	
	<section><h2>Fun Fact #1: The name "Armadillo" translates from Spanish for "Little Armored One"</h2>
	  <img src="images/armadilloart.jpg" alt="Mexican Armadillo Sculpture" height="300" width="550" >
	  <p>
	    This is one of those times when you learn what something means and realizes that some times people 
	    who name things can be lazy or uncreative. However, this makes sense since Armadillos are native to 
	    parts of Central and South America, where Spanish is mainly spoken.  	  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Actually, my experiences with Armadillos consists mostly of seeing them as roadkill like every 500 feet 
	    while driving around in Mexico. That was probably the inspiration for the pose of the armadillo sculpture
	    seen above. Look at that back, It's broken for a reason. I mean, have you seen Rango? It's literally a 
	    joke that they love getting hit by cars or something. Which leads us to our next fact!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I dont know, I kind of prefer the Aztec name for them since they called them Turtle Rabbits. That's 
	    so much cuter and is a much better description.

	<section><h2>Fun Fact #2: Nine-banded Armadillos jump three feet into the air as a defense mechanism</h2>
	  <img src="images/armadillojump.jpg" alt="Armadillo Mid-jump" >
	  <p>
	    <strong>Author's Note:</strong> I literally laughed so hard when I read this that my roomate thought
	    I was being murdered in my room from the way I was screaming and then crying. With laughter, of course.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    After learning this, it makes so much more sense that I see so many just squashed on the side of the
	    road. They really see a car coming and think, "If I jump, I won't die." If they literally did the 
	    opposite of that, they would be safe. Why do people talk about lemmings when armadillos are constantly 
	    either trying to kill themselves or commit insurance fraud.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I guess the alternative would be stuffing their nose as close to their crotch as possible like the 
	    three-banded armadillo, but, I don't know, that kinda feel like its worth it.

	<section><h2>Fun Fact #3: Some animals are jealous of armadillo anatomy and try to pretend like they are one.</h2>
	  <img src="images/catadillo.png" alt="Cat but Armadillo" >
	  <p>
	    Okay, I'm kidding but I needed to incorporate a picture of this kitten in somehow. Don't act like 
	    you're not glad I did.
	  </p>
    </section>
  
	<section><h2>Fun Fact #4: Its huge. A third of the size of its body</h2>
	  <p>
	    I don't have to explain what "it" is. You know what I'm talking about. And yes it is a true fact.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Do whatever you will with this new information.
